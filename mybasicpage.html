        <p>I am excited to be part of the CIT 230 class and to learn from one another.<br>
           This page is my test-site, a place where I can try different and new things, <br>
           as I learn them. After this week's readings, I am beginning to feel more <br> comfortable with HTML; CSS and JS, however, are still a mistery for me.</p>
